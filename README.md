Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria:

 ● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day? 
 
 ● Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money? 
 
 ● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Is there a simpler price range grouping model that could be used to help direct their efforts to promote sales/marketing?
 
 ● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 

 ● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. How can customers be categorized and profiled?

# Data
The data is provided by Instacart as Excel and Pickle files with the following parameters:

 ● Customers
 
 ● Orders
 
 ● Products
 
 ● Departments

# Tools

The following python tools were used for this project:

 ● pandas, NumPy, and os - for data analysis
 
 ● matlpotlib, scipy, and seaborn - for data visualization

# Executing the Code

The code is available as jupyter notebooks under /scripts/.

To launch the notebook, open terminal and run the command:

 ● importing data: jupyter notebook '''importData.ipynb'''

 ● generate CrossTabs: jupyter notebook '''createCrossTabs.ipynb'''
